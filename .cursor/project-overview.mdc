# Certus Project Overview

Certus is a local-only, high-performance API Gateway written in Rust.  
Its goals are:

- Extremely fast request routing
- Advanced load balancing
- Accurate distributed rate limiting
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Observability via structured logging + Prometheus-style metrics
- Strong authentication (JWT)
- Local-first design philosophy

## Architectural Outline

- **Gateway (Rust)**: Handles reverse proxying, LB, caching, rate limiting, metrics, auth.
- **Frontend (Next.js + Bun + Tailwind)**: Dashboard for analytics + local control panel.
- **Cargo Workspace**: Manages all backend crates.
- **Local-only**: No cloud dependencies, no external services unless explicitly added.

## Style & Guidance

- Keep backend modular using focused crates.
- Prefer async Rust patterns with Tokio.
- Use consistent hashing + algorithmic structures where appropriate.
- Follow zero-cost abstraction principles.
